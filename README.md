# Rot13-Encryption-and-Decryption
***
# Description
This is a program that implements the use of a Rot13 cypher. The program will take what is written in a .txt file and save the written portion, after it has been encrypted, into a separate .txt file. It can also take an a already encrypted file and decrypt it, saving the decryption into a separate .txt file.
# Usage
When running the program, if choosing to encrypt a document, it is easiest to bring the file into the workspace folder (Rot13 Encrypt-Decrypt). A .txt file labled Original.txt is already provided to be written in. If a file for the encryption or decryption has not been made, you can type in a file name and extension, and a file will be created and saved within the folder.
